##  Project Overview

**CodeCollab** - platform designed to **streamline the workflow** for development teams tackling large-scale projects.

## Key Features (Current Functionality)

CodeCollab currently functions as a **robust task management system**, specifically tailored for software development needs:

* **Flexible Task Management:** Create, assign, and track tasks with full customization of statuses and workflows.
* **Deadline System:** Set and monitor deadlines to maintain team discipline and ensure timely sprint completion.
* **Team Organization:** Add users and organize teams around specific projects.
* **Powerful Backend:** The platform is built on the fast and modern **FastAPI** framework, ensuring high performance and scalability.

## Development Roadmap

Future plans include:

* **Git Integration:** Native repository support for direct interaction with project codebases.
* **File System:** Cloud storage capabilities for sharing project documentation and resources.
* **Real-time Chat:** An integrated tool for immediate team communication linked directly to projects.
